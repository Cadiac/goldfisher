# Goldfisher CLI ðŸŽ£

This tool aims to [goldfish](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Goldfishing) the fastest possible wins with the given decks in non-interactive games of Magic: The Gathering. This data can be used to gather statistics on average winning turns with different versions of the decks, helping to gauge effects of deck building.

For now, the supported decks are:

[Premodern Pattern Combo](https://scryfall.com/@Cadiac/decks/79289c7a-f60c-4eff-809e-d83f86dd37c0), which contains a deterministic combo kill if the following condition is met:
1. Any repeatable sac outlet is available
2. You control a creature that isn't the sac outlet
3. You resolve a Pattern of Rebirth on the creature or you have Academy Rector on the battlefield

[Premodern Aluren](https://scryfall.com/@Cadiac/decks/a4aa0d03-bc15-44eb-bf4e-cb95d4dc8cbc), which goes off with Aluren by repeteatedly playing Cavern Harpy and bouncing creatures back to hand.

See [goldfisher](https://github.com/Cadiac/goldfisher/) library for the simple game engine implementation.

## Installation

Follow [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) installation instructions.

## Usage

```console

    goldfisher-cli [OPTIONS] --strategy <STRATEGY>

OPTIONS:
    -d, --decklist <DECKLIST>    Path to custom decklist file
    -g, --games <GAMES>          Number of games to simulate [default: 100]
    -h, --help                   Print help information
    -s, --strategy <STRATEGY>    The name of the deck strategy to use [possible values:
                                 pattern-combo, aluren]
    -v, --verbose                Print game actions debug output (slow)
    -V, --version                Print version information

```

You can run debug builds of the tool with cargo:

```console
$ cargo run -- --strategy pattern-combo --games 10 -v
```

For faster simulations adjust the `simulated_games` variable in `main.rs` and run executable as release build:

```console
$ cargo run --release --strategy pattern-combo --games 100000
```

To use your own custom decklist provide a path to the file:

```console
$ cargo run --release --strategy pattern-combo --games 100000 -d ./path/to/your/decklist.txt
```

## Example game

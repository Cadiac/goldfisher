# Goldfisher ðŸŽ£

This tool aims to [goldfish](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Goldfishing) the fastest possible wins with the given decks in non-interactive games of Magic: The Gathering. This data can be used to gather statistics on average winning turns with different versions of the decks, helping to gauge effects of deck building.

For now, the only supported deck is my build of [Premodern Pattern Rector](https://scryfall.com/@Cadiac/decks/79289c7a-f60c-4eff-809e-d83f86dd37c0), which contains a deterministic combo kill if the following condition is met:
1. Any repeatable sac outlet is available
2. You control a creature that isn't the sac outlet
3. You resolve a Pattern of Rector on the creature or you have Academy Rector on the battlefield

## Installation

Follow [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) installation instructions.

## Usage

You can run the tool with

```console
$ cargo run
```

For fast longer simulations adjust the `simulated_games` variable in `main.rs` and run executable as release build:

```console
$ cargo run --release
```
